                <div class="text">Since graduation, I'm unsure what career I should choose for. 
                    Therefore, I decided to self-study languages because of that are useful
                    in various industries, and I spent a lot of time learning English and Japanese. 
                    in my current job, I frequently interact with software engineers.
                    When I hear them talk about how software can accomplish things
                    that Common people can't (such as snap up tickets or Web Crawler),
                    I suddenly feel that being a software engineer is the career 
                    i want to pursue in my life

                    For me, free tuition is definitely not one of the main reasons. 
                    I hope to acquire the same level of expertise as those who majored 
                    in Computer Science & Information Engineering in a short time. 
                    I believe that your school selects students carefully, 
                    so I trust that your courses are high quality and high output, 
                    That's why my primary reason for applying to AppWorks School

                    When I was young, I didn't like English, so I tried to avoid anything related
                    to English as much as possible. However, when I graduated, I realized 
                    the importance of English in this world, so I set a goal for myself, the goal is  
                    score above 900 in the TOEIC exam. I started forcing myself to learn 50 
                    new words every day, which is literally Start from scratch. 
                    It took me five years, but I finally achieved some results. Until now, 
                    I have taken the TOEIC exam many times and scored above 800 ten times. 
                    However, I still haven't reached my goal of 900, and on several occasions, 
                    when the results were announced, I couldn't sleep because I felt so upset on those nights.
                    But even now, I haven't given up on this goal because I know that once I give up,
                    it will be impossible to achieve it forever

                <div class="text">
                    Although I am still planning my long-term goals, my short-term goal is to become 
                    proficient in programming. Currently, my plan is to learn the basis of software development
                    and related knowledge in the second half of 2023. At the same time, I will also develop 
                    some side projects and upload them on LinkedIn for someone else to see my work.
                    I hope to officially enter this field by early 2024.
